i have to use this college degree for something

job security prolly better too ðŸ˜‘

wanna hear a funny story, in my town, they wont do Eid namaz at a hotel thats right next to a hooters lol ... their argument is that they dont want like kids to see the sign for hooters next to the hotel for Eid namaz but the counterargument other ppl made was that Eid namaz is at like 7 am and hooters isnt even open at that time, but they just wont do it there ðŸ˜‚
